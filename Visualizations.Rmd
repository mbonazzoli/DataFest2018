### Matt's Chunks for visualization
```{r}
# Relationship between clicks and applies per state
ggplot(indeedState, aes(x= stateClicks, y=stateApplies, label=State)) + geom_point() + geom_text(aes(label=State), hjust= 0, vjust = 0, alpha=0.5)
```
Linear relationship between clicks and stateApplies, more clicks more applies. Applies per click is standard across states.


Populaton concentration impacts need for indeed?
```{r}
# Visualization of clicks per unemployed people in state
ggplot(indeedState, aes(x= State, y = clicksPerUnemployed)) + geom_col()
```


```{r}
# Visualization of clicks per unemployed people in state
ggplot(indeedState, aes(x= jobPostings, y = stateClicks)) + 
  geom_point() 
```


Map of U.S. with residual based on model (details filled in by brett) glyphs sized for city population placed in city location
```{r}
myLocation <- c(-130, 25, -60, 55)
map<-get_map(location=myLocation, zoom = 4, maptype = "roadmap",
             source='google', color = 'color')


meanRes <- mean(indeedCity$Residual)
ggmap(map) + geom_point(data = indeedCity, aes(x = long, y = lat, size =  log(abs(Residual)), colour = Residual), alpha = 0.5) + scale_size(range = c(0.5, 7)) + scale_colour_gradient2(midpoint = meanRes, low = 'red', mid = 'white', high = 'blue') + scale_size(range = c(0, 8))

```
