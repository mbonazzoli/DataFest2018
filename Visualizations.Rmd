### Matt's Chunks for visualization
```{r}
# Relationship between clicks and applies per state
ggplot(indeedState, aes(x= stateClicks, y=stateApplies, label=State)) + geom_point() + geom_text(aes(label=State), hjust= 0, vjust = 0, alpha=0.5)
```
Linear relationship between clicks and stateApplies, more clicks more applies. Applies per click is standard across states.


Populaton concentration impacts need for indeed?
```{r}
# Visualization of clicks per unemployed people in state
ggplot(indeedState, aes(x= State, y = clicksPerUnemployed)) + geom_col()
```
